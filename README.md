# OpenCV
Head Detection using OpenCV
This project is an implementation of a head detection algorithm using OpenCV in Python. The goal of this project is to accurately detect the number of heads present in a given frame. This can be useful for various applications such as surveillance systems, crowd management, and people counting.

# How it works
The algorithm works by using a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier to detect frontal faces in the frame. Once the faces are detected, the number of faces is considered to be the number of heads present in the frame.

# Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

 -Python 3.x
 -OpenCV library
 -Haar Cascade Classifier XML file

#Future Work
There are several areas for improvement in this project, including:

 -Optimizing the algorithm for faster processing.
 -Improving accuracy by training a custom Haar Cascade Classifier on head images.
 -Adding additional features such as tracking and counting the number of people entering and exiting a certain area.
